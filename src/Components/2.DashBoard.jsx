//what i learned from React Admin Dashboard project

// Always start with what and how many page you need in your website -- like login,home, user etc.

// why use jsx extension -- it's easy to handle html elements inside this extension

// always see how to use react-router-dom by their update documentation -- as it gets updated quite frequently

// we can create nested routes, see the users route for more.

// after setting up the routes, make sure to analyse common componet and create them, eg -- navbar, sidebar, etc.

// in html -- try to divide everthing in div or similar level, for better understanding and easy css.

// include atleast div,span or any other element inside <li> tag.

// <li> tag has it's own margin and to prevent this make m0,p0 in ul

// for icons, table and more -- checkout material UI -- we can change the color of icons
