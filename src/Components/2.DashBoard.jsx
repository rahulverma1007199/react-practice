//what i learned from React Admin Dashboard project

// Always start with what and how many page you need in your website -- like login,home, user etc.

// why use jsx extension -- it's easy to handle html elements inside this extension

// always see how to use react-router-dom by their update documentation -- as it gets updated quite frequently

// we can create nested routes, see the users route for more.

// after setting up the routes, make sure to analyse common componet and create them, eg -- navbar, sidebar, etc.

// in html -- try to divide everthing in div or similar level, for better understanding and easy css.

// include atleast div,span or any other element inside <li> tag.

// <li> tag has it's own margin and to prevent this make m0,p0 in ul

// for icons, table and more -- checkout material UI -- we can change the color of icons

// Use &:nth-child(<index of child>) for advance css -- check it in sidebar .bottom

// try using new div for padding and margin -- rather than distroying the main div.

// give background colour transprent in case we are using dark and white mode.

// scss -- &::placeholder

// margin-right on df children is equal to giving gap on df div.

// Sometimes it's better to give flex:<like 1> than to apply width, reference to .widget class. aka using flex is way better than custom widget.

// refer to 'box shadow generator'

// Width: max-content is used when like border is overflowing, so this make sure ki jitna content utna he rahega.

// <div className='test test1'> to access test1 in scss -- .test{ &.test1{<assign property>}}
