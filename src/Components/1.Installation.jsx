    // as you know based on the new documation on 14/5/23, many people complained that create-react-app is too slow and outdated. 
    // after the documentaton they suggest a framework than using a pure react library, npx create-react-app is a next.js command.
    // and this states the vision of future react is server side rendering. So for begineers it should be important to know that why they are using this thing over that and if they have a reason to jump then they can but make sure to build some project on that.
    // Is react dying -- NO
    // Now what to choose
    //  you won't be using react router dom but instead you will use app directory to create folder structure to define routes
    // other difference is rendering components and pages -- so if you have an highly interactive website use CSR (client side rendering) if not then use SSR (Server side rendering) -- as SSR sends the render output which make website ranking great.

    // Compare react with other, check front-end frameworks, rendering framework and more. to get the overall idea of future technology.
