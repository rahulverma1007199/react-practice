    Use of Images/Rectangles in Buttons, Inputs, Cards
        Button
            never desgin a button like - recentange then text and group them
            make sure have to correct padding
            for better practive
                grabe a frame  give it fill and border radius - add text - select both - apply auto layer
        Same for input
        Images in Card
            remove blank rectange and auto layout 
            basically the goal is to reduce the layers
    
    Best Practices for Text Layers
        for single words/line use auto-width and apply auto layout to frame
        for multie text - use auto heigth


    Best Practices for Lines and Borders
        rather than creating actual lines create border


    Using Components for Scalable design

    Best Practices for Structuring your design
        Remove unnecessary groups/frames
        use frame intest of group
            why beacuse we can apply autolayout to frames

        frame up items accordding to different section
        apply auto layout and responsieness constraints
