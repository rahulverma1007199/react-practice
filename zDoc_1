JS Mastery

Transforming Design Into Full function app in next js and tailwind
    in this we can 
        - search
        - filter by area
        - property list with pagination
        - superbase to automatically fetch apis

we need a figma design and we draft that design
    install plugins in figma
    - locofy
        create a project - framework to be any things - (author choose next js)
            also choose javascript, tailwind, px, kebab case

    follow the below steps
    1. Optimise Design 
        select a page and optimise
        this is realted to figma design so make to go to each page and check the responsive too
    2. tag interactive elements
        in figma every thing is rectangle so we have to tag elements like button, 
        for auto tag - it is easy
        for manual tag - just click the element and add the property
        we can also add links
    3. Editing styling and layout
        configue style like hover or custom break points - aka responsive
        to fix - click the container and change the figma property
        navbar related fix will be also done here
    4. Adding action
        now as our design is reponsive and styled
        here we add click action - like open url, change page
        select a button
    5. sync to locofy builder
    6. create components
        review ai create components
    7. Configure Code
        Title, meta desc
        change the project into typescript
    8. Export/sync with github

    import code locally and fix it
