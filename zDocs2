In TDD
we write test cases that get failed first and then make them sucess and then refactor them aka improvise

TO efficiently coverage the app we have 3 type of test cases

- Unit test- can give code coverage but code assurance comes from E2E
    its great for
    - Pure Function
    - Core business logic - like for payment
    - anything that is critical

- E2E test -
    for this use cypress
    best for how many action can use takes
    like login & payment test

- Integration test - where mocking is needed
    like lots of db call, api
    basically anything is between unit & e2e
